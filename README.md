# Balloonatic Project-Phase-2:-
- This is the second phase of balloonatic project in which I include some more features compared to phase 1.
- In this phase I include login and registration functionality , basic input type validations as well as patterns.
- This phase is developed using Express and EJS.
- If you want to use my project there are some basic requirements which are necessary to be installed in your system.
  Node JS
  Express JS
  EJs 
- In this phase users can register as well as login to their account. 
- To run this project after installing above necessary technologies you just have to open powershell. You can use the "LS" command to see the correct folder and files.
  After that just type "npm start" command and then copy the resulted server path. for example:- "http://localhost:8000" 
- So we can learn lots of new functionalities using express js and ejs.
